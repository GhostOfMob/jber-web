            <p>In the current year, 2024, as we move past the pandemic era and adapt
                to new living practices, people are going outside more, technology is
                rapidly advancing, and artificial intelligence is increasingly integrated
                into daily life. As Information Technology students, we aim to incorporate
                these advancements into our studies.<br><br>

                One noticeable post-pandemic trend is the surge in private vehicle sales, leading
                to a higher demand for transportation modes and a rise in vehicle-related accidents.
                We've identified a specific issue with the repair and maintenance of this growing
                number of vehicles, many consumers are unsure where to get their vehicles serviced.<br><br>
                
                In 2023, around 10,600 electric vehicles were sold in the Philippines, a significant
                increase from approximately 1,000 units sold the previous year. Since 2020, electric
                vehicle sales have been rising steadily. With more hybrid and electric vehicles on
                he roads, which require specialized repair and maintenance, consumers need reliable
                repair shops like Jber Auto Repair for their vehicles, both new and old.</p>
